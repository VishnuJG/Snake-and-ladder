# Snake-and-ladder
Simple Snake and ladder game with python
This was a task given to us when we were in 1st Sem and the task was to build a game or application using python. With the little time we had of a month, we were able to 
bring out this game, which is working to some extent. This didnt exactly meet our expectation but sure was enough to pass the expectation of the evaluator.
I am still working on making this more userfriendly.
